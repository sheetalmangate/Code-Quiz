## Concept

The concept of this project is to create a quiz game that allows users to test their knowledge in various categories, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game will provide a fun and interactive way for users to challenge themselves and improve their understanding of these technologies.

## Features

- Multiple categories: Users can choose from different categories to focus their quiz on a specific topic.
- Score tracking: The game will keep track of the user's score.

## User Story

AS A USER, I want to be able to choose a category of my choice, so that I can test my knowledge based off what I have learned from the past.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given I am a user
When I select a category of my choice
Then the selected quiz would show what quiz I have selected, a brief description and how many questions there are.

Given I am a user
When I select start
Then the modal will show up to enter a username to proceed the quiz; if no username is provided, there will be an erorr.

Given I am a user
When I hit Start Quiz after inputting a username
Then the page redirect to the Quiz page

Given I am a user 
When I submit the quiz
Then the Quiz Results will be accessible via DevTools under Application tab > Local Storage
